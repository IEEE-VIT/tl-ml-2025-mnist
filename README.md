Introduction to Machine Learning: A Hands-On Workshop
This repository contains the complete materials for a hands-on, interactive workshop on the fundamentals of Machine Learning. It's designed for beginners and covers the essential theory, the mathematics behind the algorithms, and practical implementation with popular Python libraries.

üöÄ Workshop Overview
This workshop is structured to provide a comprehensive yet approachable introduction to ML. We will explore:

The Core Concepts: Understanding the three main types of machine learning.

Data Handling: Hands-on data analysis and visualization.

Regression: Delving into the mathematics of predictive modeling.

Neural Networks: Building a foundational understanding of deep learning by tackling a classic problem.

üìö Key Topics Covered
Types of Machine Learning:

Supervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning
